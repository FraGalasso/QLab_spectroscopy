code:

data_prep:  to be used for preparing data from the first oscilloscope. need to modify filename etc
data_prep_lecroy: to be used for preparing data from the second oscilloscope
linewidth.py: 


For LINEWIDTH ANALYSIS
dependencies: functions, data_prep_lecroy, linewidths
- data_prep_lecroy on all files
- Fra produced the peaks list files "intensity000x_peaks.csv"
- Marta analyzed with "linewidths_calib_plots.py"
